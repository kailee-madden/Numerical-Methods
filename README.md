# Numerical-Methods

A variety of numerical methods implemented in Python. Uses Python v3.6.
Covers the following PDEs:
- finite element method
- finite difference method
- crank-nicolson method
- euler method
- upwind methods

## Numerical Linear Algebra 
This subfolder contains C++ code for numerical analysis methods such as Cholesky decomposition
